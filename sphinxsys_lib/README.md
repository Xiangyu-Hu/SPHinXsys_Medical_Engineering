## SPHinXsys new feature: turning “mesh nightmares” into smooth simulations

Ever had a perfect-looking CAD model that refused to mesh?

Hidden leaks (those tiny yellow marks in the figure) can completely derail numerical simulations — and repairing them can be tedious and frustrating.

![Leaking Geometry](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D22AQF5CCANH4NQgQ/feedshare-shrink_2048_1536/B4DZiQ_oVfHYAw-/0/1754779257657?e=1758153600&v=beta&t=ugXbUmTgQQ4s7bjkO_f-zY7Y5yIOsUzlE1-sobnqLWc)

With SPHinXsys level set techniques, you can skip the repair work.  
We directly convert your original (even leaky) geometry into particles, then apply a physics-based relaxation to produce a clean, body-fitted, and uniformly distributed particle set — ready for simulation.

No more chasing tiny gaps. Just upload your model and let the algorithm do the work.

You can check the test cases
`test_3d_particle_relaxation_single_resolution_sycl`
for different geometries in the `data` folder,
which showcase the capabilities of our specially designed framework.

Your tests, comments and modification of these test cases would be very welcomed!

## Repository Description

SPHinXsys (pronunciation: s'fink-sis) is an acronym from **S**moothed **P**article **H**ydrodynamics for **in**dustrial comple**X** **sys**tems.
The multi-physics library uses SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) as the underlying numerical method
for both particle-based and mesh-based discretization.
Due to the unified computational framework, SPHinXsys is able to carry out simulation and optimization at the same time.
For more information on the SPHinXsys project, please check the project website: <https://www.sphinxsys.org>.

## Examples at a glance

Using SPHinXsys library, straightforward and fast multi-physics modeling can be achieved.
Here, we present several short examples in flow, solid dynamics, fluid structure interactions (FSI) and dynamic solid contact.

## Fully compatible to classical FVM method

Through the unified computational framework in SPHinXsys,
the algorithms for particle methods are full compatible to those in the classical finite volume method (FVM).
The following gives an example of the flow around cylinder problem solved by FVM in SPHinXsys.

<a href="https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys/blob/master/tests/2d_examples/test_2d_FVM_flow_around_cylinder/2d_FVM_flow_around_cylinder.cpp">
<img src="https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys-public-files/blob/master/videos/fvm-sphinxsys-flow-around-cylinder.gif" height="168px"></a>

Note that the code for FVM algorithm is exact the same one for particle interaction in SPHinXsys.
The only difference is that SPHinXsys reads a predefined mesh, other than generate particles, before the computation.

## Target-driven optimization

The unique target-driven optimization is able to achieve the optimization target and physical solution all-in-once,
which is able to accelerate optimization process greatly.
The following gives an example of optimizing the conductivity distribution
for a thermal domain problem targeting minimum average temperature.

<a href="https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys/blob/master/tests/optimization/test_2d_VP_heat_flux_optimization/VP_heat_flux_optimization.cpp">
<img src="https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys-public-files/blob/master/videos/optimization.gif" height="192px"></a>

Note that the physical solution of the thermal domain (right) and the optimal distribution of conductivity (left)
are obtained at the same time when optimization is finished.
Also note that the entire optimization process is very fast and
only several times slower than that for a single physical solution with given conductivity distribution.  

## Python interface

While SPHinXsys is written in C++, it provides a python interface for users to write python scripts to control the simulation,
including carry out regression tests for continuous integration (CI) and other tasks.
One example is given below for the dambreak case.
Please check the source code of
[2D Dambreak case with python interface](https://github.com/Xiangyu-Hu/SPHinXsys/blob/master/tests/test_python_interface/test_2d_dambreak_python/dambreak_python.cpp)
for the usage.
