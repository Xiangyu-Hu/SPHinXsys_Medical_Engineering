# ![SPHinXsys Logo](sphinxsys_lib/assets/logo.png) SPHinXsys Medical Engineering

## Introduction

SPHinXsys Medical Engineering is a specialized extension of the SPHinXsys library, designed to facilitate the simulation and analysis of medical engineering applications using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods. This repository provides tools and examples for modeling complex biological systems, medical devices, and physiological processes.

## Features

The present main features of SPHinXsys Medical Engineering include:

- **Hemodynamics**: Simulate the blood flow and interactions within the cardiovascular system.
- **Fluid-structure interaction**: Analyze the interaction between fluids and deformable structures, such as heart valves and arterial walls.
